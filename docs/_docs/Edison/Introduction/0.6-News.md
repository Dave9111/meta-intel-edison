## What's new for this release
 1. Removed non-acpi code paths  
    Dropped `acpi` from `DISTRO_FEATURES`. ACPI is now enabled by default for U-Boot, kernel and user space.
    {% include note.html content="Remember that the no-ACPI branch at this point in time is the only one where MRAA and UPM are working. If you are depending on MRAA stick to the sumo32 branch (now frozen). Or better, help us out by fixing MRAA Edison platform support." %}
 2. Linux upgrade to 5.2.0 and U-Boot to v2019.04  
    From 4.20 thanks to the amazing work of Andy Shevchenko and the help of Georgii Staroselskii we now have gadget and OTG support. This means that connecting microUSB 2 (see [Flashing only U-Boot](2.3-Building-and-flashing-U-boot.html#flashing-only-u-boot)) to your desktop USB port allows for a 200Mb/s ethernet-over-USB connection, access to the boot partition and a virtual COM port.
 3. Elimination of hostapd  
    With the possibility of upstream (WAN) connection with ethernet-over-usb (OTG) or through a ethernet USB dongle (device) we can select a secondary (fallback) wifi connection. Or now connman supports that fully, tether the wifi connection, turning Edison into a wifi access point.  
 4. Update to Yocto Thud
 5. Gadget  
    Added scripts to setup OTG gadget on first plug.
 6. run-timezone   
    Add service to set time zone automatically using a geolocation service.
 7. ap-mode-toggle 
    Original edison script now switched completely to connman.
 8. python3-bottle  
    Add recipe for bottle, a python based web server (preparing for oobe update).
 9. linux  
    Enable kernel led driver including heartbeat.
 10. bluetooth_bd_addr  
    Add service to load bluetooth address from firmware. This allows bluetooth tethering.
 11. rng-tools  
    Provide TRNG as a source of entropy to Edison, needed to login quickly after boot using ssh.
 12. pwr-botton-handler  
    Push power bottin 3x to pair using bluetooth and use last 6 digits from serial number as pin (preparing for oobe update).
