## What's new for this release
 1. Documentation  
    This documentation has been added to sumo32 to reflect the status of the branch at all times.  
    The documentation can be read using a mark down viewer like ReText or when stored on Github, by enabling Github to generate the documentation to Github Pages.  
    If you prefer to generate the documentation locally, install Jekyll, go to the /docs directory and run:
```
    jekyll serve --incremental
```
 2. Add edison-image-minimal
    
    We have added a minimal image that others can include/require in their own application meta layers. It's easier to have a minimal image than removing stuff in the bbappends. Thanks Georgii Staroselskii.
    
 3. End of the line for sumo32 (non-acpi)  
    With Andy Shevchenko focussing on ACPI ([Why ACPI and no-ACPI?](1.3-ACPI-or-not.html#why-acpi-and-no-acpi)) new kernels with the particular patches to get I2C working will become more and more difficult to maintain without any spectacular new features to be expected. The same holds for U-Boot.  

    Instead, we will freeze sumo32 and only take pull requests for bug fixes.

    {% include note.html content="Remember that the no-ACPI branch at this point in time is the only one where MRAA and UPM are working. If you are depending on MRAA stick to this branch. Or better, help us out by fixing MRAA Edison platform support." %}
